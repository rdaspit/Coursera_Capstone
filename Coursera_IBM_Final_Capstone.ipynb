Criteria to locate such as facility location should take into account the size of the city (and possibly median income levels), annual precipitation amounts (rain or how many sunny days), as well as how many other carwash locations are in the city with a rating higher/lower than a criteria. Carwash facilities need enough customers with disposable income, enough sunny days, and not too much competition (higher rating). If there are a number of other carwash facilities in the city and the other factors are suitable, we will look more closely at the ratings to determine if we can have a higher quality experience and thus compete with the lower ranking carwash facilities. Based on the amount of data I might need to limit the states or regions we review.\n",
